# UofTearsBot
An AI therapist/chatbot for mental health issues. Designed specifically for university (i.e UofT) students, who often feel overwhelmed by their courseload or are having difficulty navigating relationships, managing work-life balance, etc.
Because talking to a therapist in person is an uneasy thought for many, an AI therapist may be a more comfortable alternative; the bonus is it helps students avoid the stigma surrounding mental health.
